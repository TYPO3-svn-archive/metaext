# cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Extend Constant Editor:If enabled, the 'class.t3lib_tsparser_ext' will be xclassed to add some more subcategories which helps to arrange the editable options. no 'class.t3lib_tsparser_ext' function will actually be overwritten so this should be uncritical for the future. If you don't install this patch, all entries with extended subcategories will be grouped under the default subcategory 'Others', so this is only a cosmetic though recommended patch.

# cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Patch 6637:If enabled, the 'class.tslib_menu' will be xclassed to apply patch6637 (see: http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6637), which will give you a 'reverseOrder' for hmenu special = rootline. without applying this patch (or patching the core file itself) the reverse rootline titletag feature won't work. NOTE: This patch becomes obsolete for Typo3 >= 4.3 as this functionality will be incorporated with this version.

# cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=disableNoCacheParameter:This turns off the ability to disable caching on several locations. On the page cahing policies, via setting config.no_cache = true or disabling caching inside extensions via set_no_cache(). All these settings will be ignored then.

# cat=basic/chtml; type=boolean; label=remove ALL html comments:If post processing is enabled, this feature will remove ALL html comments (<!--TYPO3SEARCH_start/end--> and comments inside <script/style> tags will be spared, though).

# cat=basic/chtml; type=boolean; label=remove comment tags within cdata:If some extension produces additional comment tags inside cdata markings like so: '/*<![CDATA[*/ <!--  .... // --> /*]]>*/' the '<!--' and '// -->' part will get removed if this option is selected. The point is if they remain within style tags, the gecko engine is moaning about invalid selectors which is actually not an error but an avoidable warning. the flipside would be that if you turn this feature on, really very old browser might display the content of inline script and style tags, because they're not able to interprete these. if you have concerns about this or you don't encounter these sort of cdata + htmlcomment in your code, you might simply leave this feature unselected. this feature is only active if the 'remove all html comments' feature is also activated, anyway.

# cat=basic/chtml; type=boolean; label=sort headertags:If post processing is enabled, this feature will sort all the tags in the header so that the more important tags are on top. sorting follows this priority 'base > title > meta > link > style > script > conditional comment'. NOTE: ANY OTHER CONTENT will get REMOVED though. if this is not ok with you, please leave this feature disabled.
